In this segment, we explore Lists, Dictionaries, Sets, and Tuples, focusing on their unique characteristics, use cases, and performance implications. Understanding these data structures enables developers to choose the most appropriate one for their specific needs, optimizing code for speed and memory efficiency.<br><br><ul><li>Lists: Dynamic arrays suitable for storing ordered collections. They support operations like appending, sorting, and slicing.</li><li>Dictionaries: Key-value pairs that are fast for lookups and ideal for storing relationships and mapping information.</li><li>Sets: Unordered collections of unique elements, excellent for membership testing, deduplication, and set operations like union and intersection.</li><li>Tuples: Immutable sequences, typically used to store heterogeneous data, making code safer from modifications and errors.</li></ul>"
