            "body": "Differentiation is the process of finding the derivative of a function, which represents the rate at which a function's output changes with respect to changes in its input. At its core, the derivative of a function at a point <code>f'(a)</code> gives the slope of the tangent line to the function's graph at that point, defined as <code>f'(a) = lim(h → 0) (f(a+h) - f(a)) / h</code>. This concept is crucial for understanding how functions behave and change, setting the groundwork for more complex analysis and applications.",

The slope of this tangent line, indicative of the derivative of the function at x=5, is annotated in purple text positioned slightly to the right and at the same vertical level as the red dot, reading \"f'(5) = 12\". The graph features a grid background, with axes labeled 'x' and 'f(x)', and includes a legend identifying the curve and the tangent line.",

            "body": "Differentiation plays a pivotal role in optimizing algorithms in computer science, especially in machine learning. One key application is the Gradient Descent algorithm, which minimizes a function to find its lowest point. By calculating the gradient (or the derivative) of the loss function, which measures the difference between the algorithm's predictions and actual data, we can adjust parameters to improve the model's accuracy systematically. The update rule is given by <code>θ_new = θ_old - α · ∇θ J(θ)</code>, where <code>θ</code> represents parameters, <code>J(θ)</code> is the loss function, <code>α</code> is the learning rate, and <code>∇θ J(θ)</code> is the gradient of the loss function with respect to <code>θ</code>.",

A red path with marked circles illustrates the algorithm's steps from a higher loss point down to the minimum at the origin. Axis labels are X, Y, and Loss, with scaled-down numerical labels for clarity. The visualization effectively demonstrates the iterative approach of gradient descent navigating the loss surface to minimize loss.",

Unlike symbolic or numerical differentiation, AD exploits the chain rule to decompose derivatives into a sequence of elementary operations, thereby reducing computational complexity and enhancing precision in applications like deep learning. AD is based on decomposing functions into elementary operations for which derivatives are known, and then applying the chain rule, which for functions composed of operations <code>f</code> and <code>g</code> is expressed as <code>d/dx(f(g(x))) = f'(g(x)) · g'(x)</code>."
